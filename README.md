## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the chances of a student being admitted to a graduate program. It explores several regression models and evaluates their performance to identify the most effective one.

This kind of system can be helpful for academic advisors, students, and universities.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle - Graduate Admissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions). It contains 500 samples with the following features:

### Features:
- **GRE Score (out of 340)**
- **TOEFL Score (out of 120)**
- **University Rating (1 to 5)**
- **Statement of Purpose Strength (SOP, 1 to 5)**
- **Letter of Recommendation Strength (LOR, 1 to 5)**
- **Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)**
- **Research Experience (0 or 1)**
- **Chance of Admit (Target, range: 0 to 1)**
